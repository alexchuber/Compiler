# Compiler
This is a custom compiler, created
by Alexandra Cornide Huber and Abigail Martinez
for our programming language concepts class (COP4020).
The language we created has a built-in image manipulation syntax, among other standard features of programming languages.
We did this by implementing the compiler in Java.

Some topics covered in our implementation include regular expressions, context-free grammars, error handling,
top-down parsing (recursive descent), abstract syntax trees, the visitor design pattern, and of course, the steps of compilation
(lexing, parsing, type checking, etc.)
